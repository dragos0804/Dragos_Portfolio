## Instructions

### Node.js Installation

To run the project, you need to install Node.js and npm. On Windows-running machines, this can be done as follows:

1. Go to [nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the Windows Installer.
2. Launch the installer by double-clicking the downloaded file.
3. The Node.js Setup Wizard starts with the welcome screen. Click Next to proceed.
4. Review the end-user license agreement and click the checkbox to accept the terms and conditions. Click Next to continue.
5. The installer asks to choose the installation location. Leave the default location for a standard installation and click Next to proceed.
6. Select components to include or remove from the installation. The default options install Node.js, NPM, corepack, online documentation shortcuts, and add the programs to PATH. Customize the setup or click Next to accept the default values.
7. The following section shows the total required space for the installation and the available space on disk. Click OK to proceed. Select a different disk or install fewer features if the installation does not allow proceeding.
8. Choose whether to install additional dependencies for compiling native modules. Some NPM modules compile from C/C++ and require additional tools to function correctly (Python, Visual Studio Build Tools, and Chocolatey). If you use such modules, select the checkbox and click Next. The selection of this option starts an installation script after the Node.js installation is complete. For a simple installation, skip this step and click Next to proceed.
9. Click the Install button to start the installation. The installer prompts for administrator confirmation to make changes to the device. Enter the administrator password if prompted and click Yes to continue.
10.  The installation takes some time. When it is complete, the final screen shows a success message. Click Finish to complete the installation and close the installer.

Now, you can verify the installation running the following commands in a command prompt or PowerShell:
```
> node -v
```
```
> npm -v
```

### Running the application:

1. Open `Dragos_Portfolio` in an editor like Visual Studio Code.
2. Use the termiinal to travel to `personal-profile-website` via the following command:
   ```
   > cd .\personal-profile-website\
   ```
3. Then, type:
   ```
   > npm run dev
   ```
   to launch the website. An automatic opening of the web page should take place immediately after.
